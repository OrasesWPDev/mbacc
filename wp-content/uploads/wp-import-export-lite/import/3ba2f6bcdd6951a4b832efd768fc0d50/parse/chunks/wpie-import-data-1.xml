    <title><![CDATA[New Department of Labor Ruling]]></title>
    <date><![CDATA[2024-07-17 9:17:00]]></date>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>New overtime rules are now in place for salaried positions following updated regulations from the U.S. Dept. of Labor (DOL) which took effect July 1.</p>

<p>The rule, which falls under the Fair Labor and Standards Act (FLSA), raises the minimum salary threshold for employees to be considered exempt from receiving overtime. To qualify as exempt, employees must be paid on a salary basis, be paid at least the minimum salary level, and have primarily executive, administrative or professional duties.</p>

<p>Previously, the minimum salary level was $35,568 annually, or $684 per week. Now, the threshold is $43,888 annually or $844 per week.</p>

<p>The threshold will rise again Jan. 1, 2025, with a new minimum salary level of $58,656 per year or $1,128 per week.</p>

<p>The DOL rule also increased standards for &ldquo;Highly Compensated Employees&rdquo; or HCEs a from a minimum of $107,432 to $132,964 as of July 1 and increasing to $151,164 on Jan. 1, 2025.</p>

<p>The new regulations have impacted an estimated 1 million employees and will impact 3 million after the new year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the DOL by opponents to rule. A federal judge in Texas granted the state a temporary pause for certain workers employed by the state. Elsewhere, the new rule is in full effect, while litigation remains pending. This means employers must increase pay for workers to be considered exempt from overtime pay or begin paying overtime for workers who work more than 40 hours per week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Learn more about the rule by visiting dol.gov.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Tips to Recognize and Avoid Hackers]]></title>
    <date><![CDATA[2024-07-11 11:30:00]]></date>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We welcomed Ryan Foultz to Chamber Academy on June 25 to help us gain expertise in understanding attackers&rsquo; methods like malware, phishing and hacking, and how to defend against them. Ryan is the founder of PcRx Computers and has more than 20 years experience in the IT industry. He has been serving local businesses since 2007 and is native to the Conway area. He wrote the book &ldquo;Welcome To The Jungle&rdquo;- a book about cybersecurity, and presented some of the information to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>74% of organizations in the US have fallen victim to successful phishing attacks, ranging from business email compromise to ransomware. Here are practical steps you can take to identify and avoid potential hackers:</p>

<h3>Learn to recognize phishing attempts</h3>

<p>Be wary of emails impersonating trusted contacts containing suspicious links and watch out for emails demanding immediate payments or urging you to &ldquo;click here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phishing has great bait- Phishing emails often create urgency or seem highly believable. Take an extra minute or two to verify unexpected emails and verify authenticity before acting. Instead of clicking links directly, copy and paste them into your browser. Lastly, consult with colleagues to see if they received a similar email.</p>

<h3>Avoid using free Wi-Fi</h3>

<p>Public Wi-Fi networks often advertised as &ldquo;free&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t always mean free. Hackers can intercept your information through these &ldquo;free&rdquo; Wi-Fi networks. Consider using your phone as a personal hotspot when you&rsquo;re on the go.</p>

<h3>Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>

<p>An additional layer of verification makes it significantly harder for hackers to gain unauthorized access to company information. The most common method of verification is via SMS, or text message. Other methods include an authenticator app, hardware token, or fingerprint scanners,</p>

<p>By adopting these proactive measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to cyberattacks and protect both personal and organizational information.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The PGA Tour's Myrtle Beach Classic is set for May 8-11 in 2025]]></title>
    <date><![CDATA[2024-07-09 9:20:00]]></date>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Myrtle Beach, S.C. (July 8, 2024) &ndash; The PGA TOUR&rsquo;S Myrtle Beach Classic will again be played in early May in 2025, with the competition dates set for May 8-11 at the Dunes Golf and Beach Club. Chris Gotterup won the inaugural Classic in 2024, which was the first PGA TOUR event to be held along the Grand Strand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Year one exceeded our expectations, and the community is eager to see what is in store for year two,&rdquo; said Darren Nelson, tournament director, who shared the scheduled dates for 2025. &ldquo;With the backing of our title sponsor Visit Myrtle Beach and the support from our business community and public, Myrtle Beach has proven to be a great home for a PGA TOUR event in just one year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first-year event drew more than 40,000 fans, and delivered some memorable golf moments, along with the additional entertainment of two free concerts, corporate hospitality options, and a public Fan Zone. It also received rave reviews from the professional golfers.</p>

<p>Thorbjorn Olesen, who set a course record with his 10-under-par 61 on Sunday over the 7,347-yard layout to move into a tie for 16th place, said, &ldquo;I didn&#39;t really know what to expect. I&rsquo;ve never been here before. I think the golf course is great. I think there&#39;s a lot of demanding tee shots out there. I feel like you have to be on your game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Robert MacIntyre, who shared the first-round lead with a 7-under 64 before finishing tied for 13th, praised the event. &ldquo;It&#39;s unbelievable. It&#39;s a great track. I didn&#39;t know what to expect, but this is top drawer,&rdquo; said MacIntyre, who went on to claim his first PGA TOUR victory a month later at the RBC Canadian Open. &ldquo;The greens are absolutely perfect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dunes Club layout will not change for 2025, but players may anticipate a golf course that will be a bit more challenging, without any major changes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The players can expect that the golf course will be very similar to last year,&rdquo; said Steve Hamilton, director of agronomy at the Dunes Club. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any major changes for 2025. This golf course now can be as challenging as the TOUR wants to set it up. I think you&rsquo;ll see that the rough will be a little taller. It was at two inches this year. Maybe we will get it as high as three inches next year, depending on the weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The winner of the Myrtle Beach Classic is again expected to earn a spot into the PGA Championship field, which will be contested at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, N.C., from May 15-18, 2025.</p>

<p>The Myrtle Beach Classic is managed by SPORTFIVE, a global event management company. The local event was one of two stops in the Palmetto State for the PGA TOUR in 2024, joining with the RBC Heritage in April at Harbour Town Golf Links.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.&mdash;The Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce (MBACC) and Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB) announce the immediate appointment of Tracy Conner as the Interim President and CEO following the resignation of Karen Riordan.</p>

<p>Conner will collaborate with the Chamber&rsquo;s board of directors and staff to ensure the seamless continuation of the organization&rsquo;s operations and strategic initiatives during the search for a permanent replacement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tracy&rsquo;s extensive experience and commitment to the community, including his dedication to promoting the region as a premier golf destination, make him an ideal choice for this role. His leadership will undoubtedly steer the Chamber and CVB toward continued success and growth while we search for new leadership,&rdquo; said John Rutenberg, Chair of the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Conner brings more than 35 years of professional experience to the position, including extensive connections within the Grand Strand&rsquo;s business community as well as the national tourism and hospitality industries.</p>

<p>Through his leadership positions with organizations such as the Myrtle Beach Area Golf Course Owners Association and Golf Tourism Solutions, he has played a crucial role in marketing the Grand Strand as the &ldquo;Golf Capital of the World,&rdquo; securing the PGA TOUR&rsquo;s Myrtle Beach Classic and ensuring the success of its inaugural tournament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conner has been actively involved with the Chamber and CVB for several years, serving on the Board of Directors and as Chair of the Advocacy Council. He and his wife, Debbie, are long-time residents of Myrtle Beach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am honored to step into this role and look forward to working closely with our members, stakeholders and staff to ensure the Chamber&rsquo;s continued success in serving the Myrtle Beach area for which I care for so deeply,&rdquo; Conner said.</p>

<p>The Chamber&rsquo;s board of directors will soon establish a committee and select a firm to conduct a nationwide search for the next leader, with more details to be announced at a later date.</p>

We are thankful for her service, and we wish her the very best in any of her future endeavors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During her tenure, Karen has been instrumental in the local business environment, including economic growth and promoting Myrtle Beach as a premier destination for tourism. This includes leading the Chamber and CVB through milestones such as launching community enhancement efforts like the Partnership Grand Strand foundation and Keep Myrtle Beach Beautiful, rebranding the Chamber and Visit Myrtle Beach highlighted by the successful &ldquo;You Belong at the Beach&rdquo; campaign, and participating in notable events such as the Myrtle Beach Bowl and the PGA TOUR&rsquo;s Myrtle Beach Classic.</p>

I look forward to collaborating with our board of regents, alumni, future classes and community partners to advance the LGS mission and make a lasting impact in our community,&rdquo; Furtick said.</p>

<p>Now in its 45th year, LGS has become one of the region&rsquo;s preeminent leadership programs, graduating hundreds of community leaders who have made substantial contributions to the Myrtle Beach area.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been a privilege to lead LGS for the past 19 years,&rdquo; Greene said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m immensely humbled by what the program has achieved and confident that Shannon is the right person to take the helm. Her passion for enhancing the Grand Strand is inspiring, and I&rsquo;m excited to see how she&rsquo;ll elevate the program to new heights,&rdquo; Greene said.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Nine Local Charities to Benefit from 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic]]></title>
    <date><![CDATA[2024-02-29 14:19:00]]></date>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Nine Local Charities to Benefit from 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic</h2>

<h3>A total of $225,000 to be allocated</h3>

<p>Myrtle Beach, S.C. (February 26, 2024) &ndash; Nine local social service charities have been selected to receive a grant from revenue generated by the inaugural Myrtle Beach Classic, scheduled May 6-12 at the Dunes Golf and Beach Club, meaning the event will not only showcase the Grand Strand, but also benefit the area. A total of $225,000 will be allocated for 2024.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The charities selected are all doing impactful and meaningful work, and we are proud to provide assistance to further promote these programs that are making such a huge difference on the Grand Strand,&rdquo; said Darren Nelson, tournament director. &ldquo;The PGA TOUR has a time-honored tradition of supporting charities and giving back to each community where events are hosted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tournaments under the PGA TOUR umbrella donate their net proceeds each year to support local philanthropic organizations, totaling close to $4 billion to date, which is more than all other major sports leagues combined.</p>

<p>&quot;We are extremely grateful,&rdquo; said Barb Mains, who founded the Help 4 Kids charity in 1989 and has been leading the organization for 35 years. &ldquo;Oh Lord, that money will go a long way. It will help us feed the kids for two months. Our kids won&rsquo;t have to go home from school for the weekends without food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fully volunteer organization where 100 percent of every donation goes to the charity, Help 4 Kids currently delivers food to 40 Horry County schools and feeds more than 3,000 children each week. Teachers discreetly place food sacks into the students&rsquo; backpacks on Friday afternoon so they have something to eat on the weekend. In addition, Help 4 Kids provides school supplies, blankets, clothing and coats.</p>

<p>Additional charities selected are Blue Star Mothers of Coastal Carolina, Boys and Girls Clubs of the Grand Strand, Champion Autism Network, Children&rsquo;s Recovery Center, Classy Smiles, Helping Hand of Myrtle Beach, Project Golf, and SOS Care. All of the benefitting charities have 501c3 status, meaning they are non-profit, tax-exempt groups with a dedicated mission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a game-changer for us,&rdquo; said Becky Large, executive director of Champion Autism Network, a program that helps to create judgment-free experiences for people living with autism. &ldquo;We support more than 900 families in Horry and Georgetown counties who have someone on the autism spectrum. We can use these funds to create awareness and serve even more people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Myrtle Beach Classic is a dual-field PGA TOUR event sponsored by Visit Myrtle Beach and managed by Sportfive, a global event management company. The local event will be one of two stops in the Palmetto State for the PGA TOUR in 2024, joining with the RBC Heritage in April at Harbour Town Golf Links.</p>

<p>A Robert Trent Jones-designed course, the Dunes Club was incorporated in 1948. It was host to the season-ending Charles Schwab Cup Championship on PGA TOUR Champions from 1994 to 1999, with notables Raymond Floyd, Jim Colbert, Jay Sigel, Gil Morgan, Hale Irwin and Gary McCord claiming titles. Twenty-one years earlier, the Dunes Club was the site of PGA TOUR Q-School Finals in 1973, with Ben Crenshaw taking medalist honors.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Leadership Grand Strand (LGS) is pleased to announce applications are now being accepted for participation in Class 45, a 10-month leadership development program beginning in August.</p>

<p>LGS is an initiative of the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce that provides transformative leadership training activities and exclusive behind-the-scenes tours of Grand Strand institutions in order to cultivate a dynamic corps of individuals who are well informed, committed and exceptionally qualified.</p>

<p>LGS is open to residents of Horry or Georgetown counties. Candidates may self-nominate or be nominated by an organization. Participation is limited and reflects the demographic, geographic and professional diversity of the Myrtle Beach area.</p>

<p>Criteria for selection include evidence of leadership abilities, potential to provide leadership to the Grand Strand, interest in community affairs, desire to volunteer and commitment to become a more involved member of the community. Participants and their sponsoring organizations must be willing to invest the time required to participate, which includes a two-day retreat in September, a full day of classes the first Thursday of each month and 75 hours of community service.</p>

<p>The cost of the program is $1,499 per person. Applications, along with three letters of reference, are due by June 30, 2024.</p>

<p>Scholarship opportunities are available through the William F. Pritchard Scholarship Fund and Bennie J. Swans Jr. Scholarship Fund. The William F. Pritchard Scholarship Fund awards tuition assistance to qualified applicants as determined by the LGS Board of Regents. The Bennie J. Swans Jr. Scholarship Fund provides full tuition to one applicant from an underrepresented or marginalized group, and the recipient is selected by the chamber&rsquo;s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council.</p>

<p>Hosted by Grand Strand Young Professionals (GSYP) and sponsored by Grand Strand Health, the roast is a charitable fundraiser for Substitutes for Santa, which provides 150 Horry County students with holiday gifts and festive entertainment in December.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shuckin&rsquo; on the Strand is a very popular event for Grand Stranders and visitors alike. The food and music are exceptional, yet the true essence lies in the fact that all proceeds go toward our annual charity to support local students,&rdquo; said Isabella Cenatiempo, GSYP liaison for the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>A limited number of tickets are currently on sale for $40, which includes admission, all-you-can-eat oysters, one plate of chicken bog&nbsp;and fixings, and two&nbsp;beers.

    <date><![CDATA[2024-01-23 11:54:00]]></date>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Shannon Detzler" src="/img/cache/lib24watch/Lib24watchFiles/1869/lib24watch_file/0-291e661adb04d1d1b6ff5b57f85faf16" style="width: 300px; height: 450px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;" />Leadership Grand Strand (LGS) is pleased to announce Shannon Detzler, president and CEO of Horry-Georgetown Technical College Foundation, is the recipient of the 2024 Ann DeBock Leadership Award.</p>

<p>Each year, the recognition is given to an LGS graduate who exhibits outstanding leadership and service to their community.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While we had incredible nominees put forth for this award, Shannon truly stood out for the many contributions she has made to our community, including volunteering at events ranging from the United Way Day of Caring to the Myrtle Beach Area Heart Association Walk and Heart Ball to the March of Dimes walk and Star Chefs Auction,&rdquo; said LGS Executive Director Diana Greene.</p>

<p>Her contributions to the community also include serving on the board of Grand Strand Miracle Leagues, raising money for the Multiple Sclerosis Society and generating thousands of dollars for St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital by organizing a fundraising event. She&rsquo;s instilling the same spirit of giving in her son, Camp, who at age three, raised more than $1,400 for St. Jude at a Trike-A-Thon event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From a young age, I was raised with the value of helping others and inspiring those around me to do the same. I strongly believe in instilling this ethos in our children early on, fostering the growth of young leaders who not only grasp the importance of empathy but also harbor a genuine passion for the wellbeing of others,&rdquo; Detzler said.</p>

<p>Her service to the community has earned her several of the region&rsquo;s most prestigious accolades, including the Jefferson Award for Public Service, Volunteer of the Year by Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce, Volunteer of the Year finalist by The Sun News and Young Professional of the Year by Waccamaw Community Foundation.</p>

<p>The Ann DeBock Leadership Award was commissioned and started by LGS Class 19 in memory of Ann DeBock, the program&rsquo;s first executive director from 1979 to 1998. During the award ceremony to be held on Jan. 26, 2024, three finalists will also receive recognition: Jerome Randall, founder of the Randall Foundation; Kate Curran, executive director of Fresh Brewed Ministries; and Donald Hovis Jr., owner of Tides Eye Photography.</p>

<p><img alt="Zavier Jones" src="/img/cache/lib24watch/Lib24watchFiles/1863/lib24watch_file/0-291e661adb04d1d1b6ff5b57f85faf16" style="width: 250px; height: 267px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;" />In his new role, Jones will collaborate with the group sales team to create unforgettable experiences for meeting and event planners during their destination and venue site inspections and familiarization (FAM) tours, as well as during their meetings or events held within the Myrtle Beach area.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Empowering Diversity: Insights from the First-Ever DEI Forum & Small Business Expo]]></title>
    <date><![CDATA[2024-01-18 10:06:00]]></date>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Three panelists face crowd inside the Horry Georgetown Technical College auditorium." src="/img/cache/lib24watch/Lib24watchFiles/1862/lib24watch_file/0-291e661adb04d1d1b6ff5b57f85faf16" style="width: 400px; height: 225px; margin: 5px 10px; float: left;" />Being open to tell stories of who you are to build rapport with others was one of the key messages shared at the first-ever Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Forum and Small Business Expo, held on Jan. 16, 2024, at the Horry-Georgetown Technical College Business Conference Center in Myrtle Beach.</p>

<p>The event was hosted by the Carolina African American Heritage Foundation (CAAHF), the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce (MBACC) and the City of Myrtle Beach and part of CAAHF&rsquo;s Grand Strand Freedom Week.</p>

<p>During the event, participants had the opportunity to hear from panelists Kelvin Waites, DEI director for the City of Myrtle Beach; Amanda Masterpaul, Lecturer, Women&rsquo;s and Gender Studies with Coastal Carolina University; and Les Echols, director of community &amp; minority enterprise with the Greater Florence (S.C.) Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>The panelist shared their insight about DEI initiatives and best practices, including these three tips shared in this cumulative overview:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take a look at who is on your leadership team. Diversity is not just about your staff, but also who is on your executive team. Examine the composition of your C-suite and those who hold influence over strategic direction over your organization. They should have the buy-in to understand DEI values and how it impacts your organization.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Go beyond the diversity statement to see everyday gains. DEI should be more than posting a diversity statement and instead be ingrained as an everyday practice in an organization. The advantages of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace is not just a matter of compliance but is linked to improved organizational performance and innovation. It shows a commitment to fairness and social responsibility, which enhances employee morale and loyalty. And, daily DEI practices can help create a more adaptive and resilient organization that&rsquo;s better equipped to navigate challenges effectively.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Give yourself and others grace. Granting grace in a DEI environment is essential for fostering a positive and constructive atmosphere. Acknowledging that individuals may be at different stages of understanding or embracing DEI concepts promotes a learning culture. Offering grace allows room for open dialogue and education, facilitating a more inclusive environment where mistakes can be seen as opportunities for growth rather than punitive measures. It encourages empathy, understanding and collaboration, ultimately contributing to a workplace culture that values diversity and works towards inclusion.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Along with the panelists, Angelique Jarvis-Simmons, bilingual business coach with the S.C. Hispanic Chamber (SCHC), spoke about the advantages Hispanic populations bring to the local business community, including how their cultural diversity enables businesses to cater to a broader range of consumer preferences. She also shared how the SCHC can provide assistance to this growing multicultural community.</p>

<p>Participants also had the opportunity to connect with more than a dozen exhibitors on hand, including South Carolina Association for Community Economic Development; SCORE Grand Strand, which offers free mentorship for entrepreneurs; SPARTA Networking, a leading DEI-focused consulting and staffing firm; Neighbor to Neighbor, a senior care provider; The Lovely Law Firm Injury Lawyers; and others.</p>

<p>Participants removed weeds, debris and litter, then landscaped the park&rsquo;s two entrances by laying mulch and planting flowers around the signs.</p>

<p>The service project was organized by Keep Myrtle Beach Beautiful (KMBB) with the support of the City of Myrtle Beach Parks Department, the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce (MBACC) and the Carolina African American Heritage Foundation.</p>

<p>Yaritza Tinoco, MBACC Community Engagement Manager and KMBB Liaison, said it was a collaborative project that took a lot of hands to make happen, but in the end, it wasn&rsquo;t about who made it happen but the neighborhood who will benefit from the upgrades to the park.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re grateful for everyone who participated in this project and donated their time and tools to make it happen. We know that these small improvements to the community can spread a bit a joy and help to make long-lasting impacts in our everyday lives,&rdquo; Tinoco said.</p>

<p>Keep Myrtle Beach Beautiful plans to return to the park next year to continue to make improvements.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[2024 South Carolina Hall of Fame Induction ceremony to take place Jan. 22 in Myrtle Beach]]></title>
    <date><![CDATA[2024-01-10 13:06:00]]></date>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Renowned Naturalist Rudy Mancke and Boxing Legend Smokin&rsquo; Joe Frazier Among 2024 South Carolina Hall of Fame Inductees Induction ceremony to take place Jan. 22 in Myrtle Beach</h2>

<p>MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.&mdash;The South Carolina Hall of Fame Board of Trustees are pleased to announce the 2024 inductees: boxing legend Smokin&rsquo; Joe Frazier, naturalist Rudy Mancke and Francis Salvador. Each of the South Carolina natives will be inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame during a ceremony on Monday, Jan. 22, 2024, at 10 a.m. at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center, 2101 N. Oak St. The event is free and open to the public.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 2024 inductees have made valuable contributions that embody the distinctive spirit of South Carolina. The achievements of Joe Frazier, Rudy Mancke and Francis Salvador have each shaped our state&rsquo;s cultural tapestry, inspiring generations to come,&rdquo; said Randal Wallace, chairman of the Official South Carolina Hall of Fame. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to induct each of these individuals into the South Carolina Hall of Fame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rudy Mancke: Renowned American naturalist and broadcaster Rudy Mancke (April 17, 1941 &ndash; Nov. 7, 2023) was born in Spartanburg, S.C., and is most widely recognized for hosting nature-focused programs such on South Carolina Educational Television &ldquo;NatureScene,&rdquo; which was filmed from 1978 to 2002. His contributions to environmental education and conservation of the region&rsquo;s diverse ecosystems, included founding the South Carolina Association of Naturalists, an organization that continues to thrive, and serving as the Naturalist in Residence at the School of Earth, Ocean and Environment at the University of South Carolina.</p>

<p>Smokin&rsquo; Joe Frazier: Born in Beaufort, S.C., Joseph William Frazier (Jan. 12, 1944 - Nov. 7, 2011) was a legendary American professional boxer who rose to prominence in the 1960s and &lsquo;70s and was nicknamed &ldquo;Smokin&rsquo; Joe&rdquo; for his relentless pressure in the boxing ring. Frazier became the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world in 1970 and is best known for his fierce rivalry with Muhammad Ali, including the iconic &ldquo;Fight of the Century&rdquo; against Ali in 1971 and the &ldquo;The Thrilla in Manila&rdquo; in 1975. Frazier was inducted into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1980.</p>

<p>Francis Salvador: Born in 1747, Francis Salvador was a notable figure in American history as the first person of Jewish faith to be elected to public office in the American colonies. A resident of South Carolina, Salvador played a crucial role in advocating for American independence and represented Ninety-Six District in the Provincial Congress of South Carolina. Tragically, his life was cut short during the American Revolutionary War when he became the first Jewish person to die in combat for the cause of American independence, losing his life in a skirmish with Loyalist forces in 1776. A plaque was dedicated in Salvador&rsquo;s memory in 1950 in Charleston&rsquo;s City Hall Park.</p>
